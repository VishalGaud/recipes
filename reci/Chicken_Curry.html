    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken curry from the Indian subcontinent typically features chicken stewed in a tomato-based sauce seasoned
        with aromatic spices. This recipe, like many others, calls for curry powder (a spice blend made with coriander,
        turmeric, cumin, and chili powder).
