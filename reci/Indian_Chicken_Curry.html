    <h1>Indian Chicken Curry (Murgh Kari)</h1>
    <img src="../assets/Indian_Chicken_Curry.webp" alt="">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Murgh Kari makes use of a potent spice blend that includes garam masala, coriander, turmeric, and cayenne pepper.
        Tomato, yogurt, and onion are also essential ingredients in this classic Indian main dish. Fresh minced garlic
        and ginger lend a pleasant sharpness.

        Our top-rated recipe uses skinless, boneless chicken breasts for a tender, evenly cooked result, but other cuts
        like tenderloin and thigh make suitable substitutions.

    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>

        <li>½ cup cooking oil</li>

        <li>1 ½ cups chopped onion</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>

        <li>1 ½ teaspoons minced fresh ginger root</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>

        <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>

        <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>½ cup water</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in batches until
                completely browned on all sides. Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet. Cook and
                stir until onion turns soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, turmeric,
                coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture; allow to heat together for about 1
                minute while stirring. Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt to the
                mixture; stir to combine.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. Pour in 1/2 cup water and bring
                to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro
                over the chicken.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run
                clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165
                degrees F (74 degrees C). Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.

            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
