    <h1>Indian Chicken Curry (Murgh Kari)</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Murgh Kari makes use of a potent spice blend that includes garam masala, coriander, turmeric, and cayenne pepper.
        Tomato, yogurt, and onion are also essential ingredients in this classic Indian main dish. Fresh minced garlic
        and ginger lend a pleasant sharpness.

        Our top-rated recipe uses skinless, boneless chicken breasts for a tender, evenly cooked result, but other cuts
        like tenderloin and thigh make suitable substitutions.
